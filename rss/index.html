Functions got the ability can return multiple values with help of tuples. What is this tuple. <br>
We will look how tuples fit into Swift type system.</p>

<p>Swift type system divided into 2 categories.</p>

<ul>
<li>names types - Types that given a name when defined.</li>
<li>compound types - Simply type without names.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tuple is a compound type. For example</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">(Int, Int)
</code></pre>

<p>Tuple is list of comma separated values, which enclose in parentheses. Tuple can also be contained with zero values. </p>

<pre><code class="language-swift    ">()
</code></pre>

<p>This is an Empty Tuple. <code>Void</code> is a <code>typealias</code> for empty tuple. <br>
Well that is this <code>typealias</code>. </p>

<h1 id="whatistypealias">What is typealias</h1>

<p>Type Alias is a given type name for existing named or compound type in swift. <br>
After defined alias name can be used instead of existing named or compound type.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">typealias Point = (Int, Int)  
</code></pre>

<p>In above example <code>Point</code> becomes a aliased type for existing tuple type of <code>(Int, Int)</code>. This is very handy for compound types like tuples.</p>

<h1 id="functionswithmultiplereturnvalues">Functions with Multiple Return Values</h1>

<p>Lets look at an example of function returning multiple values thanks to Tuples.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">func getTime() -&gt; (Int, Int, Int) {

    //Calculating Date components. 
    let date = NSDate()
    let calendar = NSCalendar.currentCalendar()
    let components = calendar.components(.CalendarUnitHour | .CalendarUnitMinute | .CalendarUnitSecond, fromDate: date)
    let hours = components.hour
    let minutes = components.minute
    let seconds = components.second

    return ( hours, minutes, seconds)
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't understand calculating dates components. Just focus on how to tuple to return multiple values of Hour, Minutes and Seconds. <br>
If you call</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">let time = getTime()  
</code></pre>

<p>Returns - <code>(.0 18, .1 17, .2 50)</code>. <br>
Values will be different for you as you call this on a different date. <br>
Individual member values of the tuple can be accessed using,</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">time.0  
time.1  
time.2  
</code></pre>

<p>Member are named using there index of appearance.  What if we want more proper name for elements. <br>
Tuple member values can be named as part of function return type.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">func getTime() -&gt; (hours: Int, minutes:  Int, seconds: Int) {  
    ...
    return ( hours, minutes, seconds)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the tuple named members can be accessed as follows.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">let time = getTime()  
time.hours  
time.minutes  
time.hours  
</code></pre>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lets iterate an swift array while filtering nil elements.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Iterate an swift array skipping nil elements with swift pattern matching power.]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/lets-iterate-an-swift-array-while-filtering-nil-elements/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6f0542ef-bcf1-4cb0-b956-3078135d93ca</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Madushan]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:23:12 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="anotherpatternmatchingusage">Another Pattern Matching Usage</h2>

<p>Swift <code>Pattern Matching</code> is great. Which enables ton of possibilities which would have ended up in nested branches in <code>ObjectiveC</code></p>

<p>Here is a very simple example of how to iterating an array skipping nil elements in swift.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">let arrayOfOptionalInts: [Int?] = [nil, 2, 3, nil, 5]  
// Match only non-nil values
for case let number? in arrayOfOptionalInts{  
    print("Found a Int : \(number)")
}
</code></pre>

<p>So as you can see this is possible thanks to power of pattern matching. Without such power it would have been something like.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">for element in arrayOfOptionalInts{  
    if let int = element{
        print("Foun a Int: \(int)")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It can be even this.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">let arrayOfTuples: [(Int?,Int?)] = [(nil,1),(1,3),(nil,nil)]

for case let (x?,y?) in arrayOfTuples{  
    print("Found non nil (Int,Int) Tuple: (\(x),\(y))")
}
</code></pre>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to Ghost]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>You're live! Nice.

Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code>&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/</code>.

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>

<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two
<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>
<li>Drink the milk  </li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like <a href="http://ghost.org">http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href="http://ghost.org">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutimages">What about Images?</h3>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img src="https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo"></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ghost - Just a blogging platform</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="workingwithcode">Working with Code</h3>

<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="readyforabreak">Ready for a Break?</h3>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!"></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
